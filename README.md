Subset of data at https://data.cms.gov/covid-19/covid-19-nursing-home-data. Made for Data Reporting course at Wake Forest University, Spring 2022.

Includes weeks beginning the first week that vaccines were available in the United States and ends the week of Jan. 30, 2022. 

Includes only N.C. rows and only columns that were missing less than half the values for those rows.
